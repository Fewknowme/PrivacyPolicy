Privacy Policy for Opslivo
Last Updated: 26 Nov 2025

RMDevelopers ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the Opslivo mobile application (the "App") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.

Opslivo is a B2B application designed for Service and Retail businesses to track profitability, employee time, and expenses.

1. Information We Collect
We collect several types of information from and about users of our App, including:

A. Personal Identification Information
Account Data: When you register (as an Owner or Employee), we collect your email address, full name, and password (hashed).

Profile Data: You may optionally provide a profile photograph, phone number, and other personal identifiers.

B. Business & Operational Data
Organization Details: Business name, logo, signature image, tax identification numbers, billing address, and invoice notes.

Client Data: Names and contact details of your clients (for Service businesses).

Financial Data: Job quotes, hourly rates, material costs, retail sales data, and expense receipts.

C. Location Data (Crucial)
GPS Coordinates: We collect precise location data (Latitude/Longitude) from Employee devices only when they perform specific actions: Clocking In and Clocking Out.

Purpose: This data is used solely to verify attendance and ensure employees are at the correct job site or retail location during work hours.

D. Media & User Content
Camera & Photos: We request access to your device's camera and photo library to allow you to upload images of receipts (for material costs/spoilage), organization logos, signatures, and profile photos.

E. Subscription & Payment Information
Transaction Data: We utilize RevenueCat to manage subscriptions. While we do not store your credit card information directly, we process data regarding your subscription status (Free/Pro), purchase history, and entitlement IDs ("Opslivo Pro") to unlock features.

Payment Processing: All financial transactions are handled by the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. We do not process or store complete payment card details.

F. Device & Usage Data
Device Identifiers: We may collect information about your mobile device and internet connection, including the device's unique device identifier, operating system, and mobile network information (via standard analytics and RevenueCat synchronization).

App Preferences: We store local preferences such as your selected Currency (via AsyncStorage).

2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect to:

Provide Core Functionality: Creating jobs, tracking time, calculating real-time profit, and generating invoices/reports.

Verify Employment Activities: Using GPS data to validate employee time logs.

Process Subscriptions: Using RevenueCat to verify your "Pro" status and restore purchases across devices.

Data Storage: Storing receipts and business assets securely via Supabase Storage.

Communications: Sending invitation emails to employees and critical account updates.

Improvement: Monitoring app performance and feature usage to fix bugs and improve user experience.

3. Third-Party Services
We share data with specific third-party service providers who facilitate the App's operation. These parties are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us:

Supabase (Backend as a Service): Used for authentication, database hosting (PostgreSQL), and file storage. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest.

RevenueCat: Used for subscription infrastructure and purchase validation. We sync your User ID with RevenueCat to manage your subscription status.

Apple App Store / Google Play Store: Process all payments for subscriptions.

4. Data Retention
General Retention: We retain your data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

Free vs. Pro Tier:

Free Tier: Historical data access is limited to the last 7 days within the App interface, but the data is retained in our database unless account deletion is requested.

Pro Tier: We retain full historical data for unlimited access as long as the subscription is active.

Deletion: If you request to delete your account, we will delete your profile and anonymize or delete your associated data (time logs, sales), subject to legitimate business record-keeping requirements.

5. Security
We implement security measures designed to protect your personal information:

Encryption: Data is transmitted via HTTPS (TLS/SSL).

Access Control: We use Row Level Security (RLS) in our database to ensure data isolation. Owners can only see their organization's data; Employees can only access data permitted by their role.

Authentication: We use secure, token-based authentication and invitation systems.

However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%.

6. Permissions
To provide the features described, the App may request the following permissions:

Location (When In Use): Required for the Clock-In/Out feature.

Camera/Storage: Required for uploading receipts and profile images.

You can revoke these permissions at any time in your device settings, but doing so may disable core features of the App.

7. Children's Privacy
Our Service is a B2B tool intended for business owners and employees. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not use the App.

8. Changes to Our Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
