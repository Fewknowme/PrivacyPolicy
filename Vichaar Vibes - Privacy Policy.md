Last Updated: October 20, 2025

1. Introduction
Welcome to VichaarVibes – a daily quote and wish generator app that lets you create beautiful, shareable thoughts using gradient designs, Hindi/English quotes, and your name. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app.
We do not collect, store, or share any personal data.
We do not use any backend servers, APIs, or third-party analytics that track you.

2. Information We Collect
A. Information You Provide

Your Name: When you generate a quote, you may enter your name (e.g., “Priya’s Wish”).
→ This is only used locally on your device to create the image.
→ It is never sent to any server, stored online, or shared with third parties.

B. Automatically Collected Data
We collect minimal, non-personal data required for app functionality:


Internet Access (INTERNET) - To load and display advertisements via Meta Audience Network
Network State (ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE) - To check internet connection before showing ads
Storage Permissions (WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, READ_MEDIA_IMAGES) - To save generated quote images to your device (if you choose “Save”) and read them for sharing

These permissions are only used when you explicitly save or share a quote.


3. How We Use Your Information

Name: Embedded in the generated image only on your device.
Storage: Used to save PNG files to your gallery or cache for sharing.
Internet: Used only to display ads. No user data is sent with ad requests.


4. Sharing & Saving Features

Share: When you tap “Share”, the app creates a PNG file and opens your device’s share menu (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.).
→ The image contains:

Your entered name
A generated quote
A watermark: "Made with VichaarVibes"
→ No tracking occurs during sharing.


Save: Saves the PNG to your device’s Pictures > VichaarVibes folder.
→ You control deletion via your gallery.

Ads may be personalized based on:
